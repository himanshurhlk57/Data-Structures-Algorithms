Sorting Algorithms
Given a sequence of elements, sorting them means that ordering them in a particular fashion. In general, when we talk about sorting, we are talking about ordering them in ascending order.

Example
Initial Sequence: 3, 4, 1, 6, 2, 5

After Sorting: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

The values might be integers, or strings, or even other kinds of objects.

The most popular sorting algorithms are:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort


Algorithm      Best Case  Average Case   Worst Case

Bubble Sort    O(n)       O(n2)          O(n2)

Selection Sort O(n2)      O(n2)          O(n2)

Insertion Sort  O(n)      O(n2)          O(n2)

Merge Sort   O(n log(n)) O(n log(n))     O(n log(n))

Quick Sort   O(n log(n)) O(n log(n))      O(n2)
