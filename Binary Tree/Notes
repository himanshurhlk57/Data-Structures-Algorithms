A tree is a non-linear data structure unlike an array, linked list, stack, and, queue.

A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node),
 where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children").

 A binary tree is a tree with a constraint where each node can have at most 2 children. The children are denoted as the left child and right child.

class TreeNode {
	public int data;
	public TreeNode left;
	public TreeNode right;
	
	public TreeNode(int data) {
		this.data = data;
	}
}
