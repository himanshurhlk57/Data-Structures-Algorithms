In a normal binary to check if a node exist in the tree or not i have
to go to each and every node in the tree to check if that node exist 
or not i.e O(n) work to find data in a tree


In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or
 sorted binary tree, is a binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key
  greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those 
  in its right subtree.
              
Binary Search Tree is a search tree as it is structured to optimally search 
for data in O(log n) time.

               8

           3      10
       1      6        14

            4    7  13

The inorder traversal of a bst -> 1 3 4 6 7 8 10 13 14 will always be in a sorted order

All the nodes of left subtree would be lesser than the current node.
All the nodes of right subtree would be greater than the current node.
