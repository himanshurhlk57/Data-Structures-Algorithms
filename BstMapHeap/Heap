Acoording to the priority you are allocating some things whether
age, vip status, criticality, gendre etc.

Queue(FIFO) -> Insert at the front, exit or delete from the front

Priority Queue -> Inserting element like a queue but allocating them
or removing them from queue depend on some factor which is known as
priority.

P1 P2 P3 P4 P5
30 20 10 40 50
Depend on what priority you want your element to come out first
if lowest priority then p3 will come out first if highest then
p5

Two type of priority queue ->
 Max- Priority Queue
 Min- Priority Queue

 Three important function in priority queue ->
 1 -> insert
 2 -> get max(getting element with maximum priority)
 3 -> get min(getting element with minimum priority)
 4 -> remove max
 5 -> remove min

Different way to implement the priority queue

 1-> Minimum priority queue ->
                   Insert      Get min        Remove min
 Array(Unsorted)     O(1)         O(n)          O(n)
 Sorted array        O(n)          O(1)          O(n)
 Unsorted LL         O(n)          O(n)          O(n)
 Bst                 O(h)          O(h)          O(h)
 Balanced Bst        O(logn)       O(logn)        O(logn)
 HahsMap             O(1)          O(n)           O(n)

 Best Data structure to implement priority queue till now we 
 found is Balanced Bst
 (isssue 1- balancing factor(lh-rh<=1))
 storage issue quite complicated

 *Heap Data Structure*

 -> Complete Binary Tree(All levels should be completely filled except the last level and the last level should be as last as can)
 Before completely filling the current level you canot fill/add element in the next level.
 After filling the current level fully you can fill in the next level
 Element should be filled in each level from left to right

                   1
                2     3
            4     5  
            If i need to remove element 5 will be removed
            if i need to add element then new element will be added to 3 left

In Complete binary tree my height will be O(logn)
Storing in Complete binary tree is easy

Lets implement Complete binary tree using array.
           10
        2       3
    7     8  9     12
13

Array -> 10 2 3 7 8 9 12 13
1-> to insert simply insert at last positon of the array(O(1)))
2-> 


 -> Heap order property
